      <p>Second-Handy is an e-commerce site which will address the problem of
        first time 1st year university students of not having all their required
        stationery such as books and equipment on time( exactly at the beginning
        of the academic year). These students are typically coming from
        underprivileged communities and/or have no bursary in place.
        This e-commerce site comes with a solution of helping these students with
        affordable, friendly second-hand books sold through the site since the book
        market sells books(even second-hand books) at hefty prices which they
        cannot afford. The reality is that these students can normally take up a loan
        for tuition/registration fees but they don't have the same option with buying
        books that they need.
